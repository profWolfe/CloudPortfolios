  <p>JBC comes with four different transitions between pages:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>First one is the main <strong>"Collapse-Slide-Expand"</strong> transition. The default transition for all actions. You can view it by going to the Typography (e.g.) page:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="?page=typography" class="ajax"><strong>Direct animation</strong></a></li>
      <li><a href="?page=typography" class="ajax slideBack"><strong>Reverse animation</strong></a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Second one is the so called <strong>"Black Disk"</strong> transition. It is available by adding special class to the link: <a href="?page=portfolio-4" class="ajax2"><strong>Portfolio</strong></a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Third one is the <strong>"Broken Screen"</strong> transition. It also available by adding special class to the link: <a href="?page=portfolio-4" class="ajax3"><strong>Portfolio</strong></a></p>
