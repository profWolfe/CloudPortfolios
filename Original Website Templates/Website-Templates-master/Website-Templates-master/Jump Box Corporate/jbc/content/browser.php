<h2 class="content-heading">Browser Compatibility</h2>
<blockquote>
  <strong>jBox.Corporate</strong> has great browser compatibility!
</blockquote>
<p>jBox.Corporate compatible with all Major browsers, even with <strong>Internet Explorer 6</strong>. Because JBC is a very smart template, it uses automatically degradation for animation and effects based on browser (and its features) detection! How does it works:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Because the IE6 and IE7 browsers do not support some of important CSS properties, the JBC will wrap some element with additional code and fix styles for other elements automatically so they will look like they should! JBC also has special stylesheets for Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7 browsers</p></li>
  <li><p>If you visit this site with browser which <strong>do not support CSS3 transitions</strong>, then the JBC will change CSS3 effects (such as Chop Slider transitions, Magic Popups, Airy Submenus, etc) to match and look fine in old browsers</p></li>
  <li><p>If you visit this site with <strong>mobile device</strong> (like iPhone, Android, iPad, etc...), JBC will detect this and will use much stronger degradation, especially for CSS3 effects to make the animation works fine on slow mobile devices!</p></li>
  <li><p>JBC has special stylesheet for visitors with <strong>disabled Java Script</strong>, so all your pages will be still accessible!</p></li>
</ul>
