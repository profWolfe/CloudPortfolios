<h2 class="content-heading">Redfield's Portfolio</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Redfield template. This template is intended for use as a photo portfolio with brief information about the author (photographer). The template is fully animated without the use of Flash technology. All animation realized through the use of jQuery and CSS3.</p>
<p>All content loaded on the fly, your users do not need to wait the reloading of entire site.</p>
<p>This template is easy to redesign, very simple and clear API. Buying this template you will also get .PSD sources and detailed documentation.</p>
<p>Photo Gallery has the great image controller. With it you can move, resize and rotate the viewed photos with good looking animation.</p>
<p>So, it's time to checkout the main section of the site - <a href="gallery" onclick="loadContent('gallery',''); return false">Photo Gallery</a>, and Ajax <a href="contacts" onclick="loadContent('','contacts'); return false">Contact Form</a> with validation.</p>
